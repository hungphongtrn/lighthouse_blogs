# Welcome to Lighthouse Research Team

At **Lighthouse Research Team**, we are driven by a singular purpose: to gain and consistently update our knowledge across varied fields in AI. Our journey, which began with a passion for learning, has evolved into a collective mission to challenge the assumption that closed technology will forever claim the peaks of innovation. We believe in the power of open research and collaboration to push the boundaries of what AI can achieve.

## Our Mission and Vision

![Mission and Vision](../../public/images/lighthouse-research-introduction/lighthouse_mission.jpg)

**Mission**: Our mission is to question and challenge the dominance of closed technology by pushing forward with open, innovative research in AI. We aim to foster an environment where knowledge is freely shared, and groundbreaking ideas emerge from collaborative efforts.

**Vision**: We aspire to become one of the most reputable research teams globally. Our goal is not just to contribute to the AI field but to lead it, setting new standards and inspiring others to follow.

## Our Activities

To fulfill our mission and vision, we engage in a range of activities that keep us at the cutting edge of AI research:

- **Specialized Seminars**: We organize focused seminars that delve deep into specific domains of AI. These sessions are designed to help us stay updated with the latest advancements and build expertise in specialized areas.
  
- **Blogging**: Sharing knowledge is at the heart of our team. We regularly publish blogs that discuss our findings, insights, and the latest trends in AI. Our blog serves as a platform to communicate with the wider AI community and contribute to the collective pool of knowledge.

- **Research Competitions**: Participating in research competitions is a critical part of our growth. These competitions challenge us to apply our knowledge in real-world scenarios, and they push us to innovate and think creatively. Our experience in competitions has helped us build a strong foundation that we continue to refine as we prepare for even more ambitious research projects.

## Domains We Cover

Our research spans a wide range of AI domains, ensuring that we stay versatile and ready to tackle the diverse challenges in the field. Some of the key areas we focus on include:

- **Multi-modality Large Models**: We explore the integration of various data types (e.g., text, image, and audio) to create models that can understand and generate multi-modal outputs.
  
- **CUDA Programming**: Efficiency in AI often comes down to how well we can leverage hardware. Our work in CUDA programming ensures that our models run optimally on GPUs, maximizing performance and reducing computation time.
  
- **On-device/Hardware ML**: As AI becomes increasingly pervasive, running models directly on devices (from smartphones to IoT devices) is essential. We focus on optimizing machine learning models for deployment on a wide range of hardware.
  
- **3D**: The world isn't flat, and neither should our models be. We delve into 3D AI applications, from computer vision to spatial computing, expanding the horizons of what's possible with AI.
  
- **MLOps**: Scaling AI solutions requires more than just good models. Our work in MLOps focuses on automating and managing the deployment, scaling, and monitoring of AI models in production environments.

## Join Us on Our Journey

The Lighthouse Research Team is more than just a research group; it's a movement towards open innovation and collective growth in AI. We invite you to follow our journey, contribute your ideas, and challenge the status quo with us. Together, we can illuminate the path to the future of AI.

Stay tuned for our latest seminars, blog posts, and competition updates!
